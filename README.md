# 🔄 push_swap

## About
The `push_swap` project challenges you to sort data on a stack, using the lowest possible number of actions and a limited set of instructions. By manipulating various types of algorithms, you'll need to choose the most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

This project involves coding a program that efficiently sorts a random list of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations.

For more detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/Surfi89/42cursus/blob/main/Subject%20PDFs/02_push_swap_en.pdf).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements
The program is written in C language and requires the `cc` compiler and standard C libraries to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the program**

To compile, navigate to the project directory and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Executing the program**

To execute the program, run:

```shell
$ ./push_swap $ARG
```

where `$ARG` is a space-separated list of integers, for example, `ARG="1 5 2 4 3"`.

### Actions

The program supports the following actions:

**PUSH**
- `pa`: Pushes the top element of stack B onto stack A.
- `pb`: Pushes the top element of stack A onto stack B.

**SWAP**
- `sa`: Swaps the first two elements of stack A.
- `sb`: Swaps the first two elements of stack B.
- `ss`: Performs `sa` and `sb` simultaneously.

**ROTATE**
- `ra`: Rotates stack A, moving the top element to the bottom.
- `rb`: Rotates stack B, moving the top element to the bottom.
- `rr`: Performs `ra` and `rb` simultaneously.

**REVERSE ROTATE**
- `rra`: Reverses rotate stack A, moving the bottom element to the top.
- `rrb`: Reverses rotate stack B, moving the bottom element to the top.
- `rrr`: Performs `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously.

### Used Algorithm

The program uses a recursive quick-sort algorithm with the median as the pivot to achieve efficient sorting. If the number of elements to be sorted is 3 or less, a different sorting function is used. Two recursive functions are employed to sort the stacks: `quick_sort_a` and `quick_sort_b`.
